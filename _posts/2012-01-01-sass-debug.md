<p>You know how much I love playing with Sass lists. I think they are the most powerful and useful feature in Sass. It's a shame there is so few functions to deal with them. This is why I made <a href="https://github.com/Team-Sass/Sass-list-functions">SassyLists</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I always wanted a <code>console.log()</code> for Sass. You know, something to debug a variable, a list, a value, whatever... There is the <code>@debug</code> function but somehow it didn't completely satisfy me. Plus, there is no console on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen.io</a> and since this is where I do most of my experiments I needed something else.</p>
<p>So I rolled up my sleeves, got my hands dirty and made my own Sass debug function. If you don't want to read but simply want to dig into the code, check <a href="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/unyBH">this pen</a>.</p>
