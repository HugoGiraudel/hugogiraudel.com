<p>A couple of days ago, I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gandoulfe/status/392640481634422785">fellow French developer say how much he hates Twitter Bootstrap</a> for websites on Twitter. And I saw a couple of fellow French developers agree with him.</p>
<p>This reminded me that no so long ago, I was a fervent defender of the tell <em>"Bootstrap is good for prototypes and CMS or stuff like this"</em>.</p>
<p>Until a recent project where I finally learnt to like Bootstrap, even for websites. But let's back up a little bit!</p>
<p>I recently got hired for quite a big project as the only front-end developer in a team of a dozen of developers. The design itself is fairly complex since it involves various layouts, multiple themes, a lot of forms and a bunch of pages. Thankfully, Symfony and its template engine Twig make it a lot easier to manage but that's not the point.</p>
<p>So when I started working on this project, they basically told me I would be the only one to deal with the front end which sounded great to me because other developers were mostly back-end devs.</p>
<p>And then they told me what I didn't want to hear: <em>"we will use Twitter Bootstrap"</em> and I was like <em>"NOOOOOOOOO!!"</em>.</p>
<p>But then they said something even worse: <em>"Bootstrap 2.3"</em> and then I was like <em>"NOOOOOOOOO!!"</em>.</p>
