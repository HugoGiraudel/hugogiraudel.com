<p>Hey guys! Just a quick article to introduce <a href="https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/Countdown.js">Countdown.js</a>, a little script I recently made. During the last weeks, I've been practicing with JavaScript. It has been on <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/05/13/things-to-do-2013/">my wishlist for 2013</a> and I'm glad that I could made some progress with it.</p>
<p>In order to start making clean scripts and not poorly designed pieces of crappy jQuery dumped in the global object, I have revisited <a href="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/jtJrq">an old countdown script</a> I made a while back with the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/">object literal pattern</a>.</p>

<h2>Why another countdown script? <a href="#why-another-one">#</a></h2>
<p>There are like a billion scripts for countdowns, timers and clocks made of JavaScript. That's like the "hello world!" of JS scripts so why making another one? Everything has been done yet!</p>
<p>Well, for one it was mostly about practicing. Making a timer script is something quite simple yet there is often lot of room for improvements. It turns out to be quite a nice playground to work in. </p>
<p>Secondly, I needed a script able to display a countdown in the way I like and not only <code>hh:mm:ss</code>. I wanted to be able to display a sentence like <code>There are still X days, Y hours and Z minutes left</code> or whatever. And since I didn't know any script that allowed the use of patterns in a string (<code>{days}</code>, <code>{years}</code>...), I started building one.</p>
<p>It worked pretty well and the code was clean enough so that I wasn't ashamed to release it on CodePen in early September.</p>

<h2>Moving on <a href="#moving-on">#</a></h2>
<p>But I wanted to try something else than the litteral object pattern. As good as this pattern can be, it becomes highly annoying when you have to deal with multiple occurrences of your widget on the same page. For some things, that's not a problem at all. But you could definitely come with the need to display multiple timers/countdowns on the same page so I needed something moar.</p>
<p>Here comes <a href="http://tobyho.com/2010/11/22/javascript-constructors-and/">Object Oriented JavaScript</a> in all its glory! Now using the script is as easy as instanciating the <code>Countdown</code> class:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>var countdown = new Countdown();</code></pre>
<p>Passing options is not any harder. Just pass an object of parameters to the constructor (you can find the list of options <a href="https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/Countdown.js/blob/master/README.md">here</a>):</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>var countdown = new Countdown({
    selector: '#timer',
    msgBefore: "Will start at Christmas!",
    msgAfter: "Happy new year folks!",
    msgPattern: "{days} days, {hours} hours and {minutes} minutes before new year!",
    dateStart: new Date('2013/12/25 12:00'),
    dateEnd: new Date('Jan 1, 2014 12:00')
});</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

<h2>Pushing things further <a href="#pushing-things-further">#</a></h2>
<p>My brother <a href="https://twitter.com/l_giraudel">Lo√Øc</a> helped me pushing things further by adding a couple of things to the project on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSHints tests to check JavaScript code quality</li>
<li>Jasmine tests to make sure the script does what it's supposed to do</li>
<li>Grunt to automate building process (also thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_agtlucas">Lucas Churchill</a> for this)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks bro! Anyway, I'm proud to tell this script as passed strict JSHint validations and Jasmine tests! Hurray!</p>
