I am a non-binary French front-end developer based in Berlin. After a couple of years working as a developer in the French banking industry, I had the great opportunity to join [Edenspiekermann](https://edenspiekermann.com) in Berlin to work on a large variety of client projects. In 2016, I quit to join [N26](https://n26.com/) as a web tech lead to improve mobile banking in Germany and Europe.

I used to be an active open-source community member. I have contributed to many projects, as well as initiated a few of my own as well. Among them, let’s mention [Browserhacks](http://browserhacks.com), [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es), [Simplified JavaScript Jargon](https://jargon.js.org), [a11y-dialog](https://edenspiekermann.github.com/a11y-dialog) and [a11y-toggle](https://edenspiekermann.github.com/a11y-toggle).

Early 2014, I authored a French book on CSS 3 entitled CSS 3 Pratique du Design Web with [Raphaël Goetter](https://goetter.fr). Early 2016, I authored a book about Sass entitled [Jump Start Sass](https://learnable.com/books/jump-start-sass) with [Miriam Suzanne](http://www.miriamsuzanne.com/).

I used to be a Google Developer Expert in front-end development, and one of the 5 nominees for the [Net Awards](https://thenetawards.com) under the [Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/developer/) category.

If you have any question, feel free to ask me anything on me [Ask Me Anything](https://github.com/hugogiraudel/ama) repository.
